make MMR tiers
make profiles for users and pros (add MMR, league, race, replay list, pro stats (if applicable), win rates, tournament wins, career winnings, teams, start dates, etc.) 
pay pros monthly for replays to extract build orders/styles -> draw hardcore users in
take community voted replays/build orders -> draw more casual scene
scrub out chat from replays to protect against cancel culture/exposing people for behavior -> focus on the gameplay to help players learn the game fast
use replay database to classify playstyles and determine (using stats) which playstyles are best vs unique strategies or unit compositions -> 
use the above to search for player pregame and learn their playstyles
somehow run a client in a browser to play through the replays on the site???


later:
clan/team pages
include matcherino api for clan organized tournaments -> check with teamliquid
use blizzard api to pull player stats for profiles.
